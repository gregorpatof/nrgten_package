# NRGTEN
Najmanovich Research Group Toolkit for Elastic Networks

NRGTEN is not yet uploaded to PyPi (it will be in the coming week). If you wish to install it as a package before that, simply clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/gregorparof/nrgten_package
```

Then change to the package directory:

```
cd nrgten_package
```

And type the following command:

```
sh install_nrgten.sh
```

This will work on both Linux and Mac OS. For Windows the commands might be a little different (full Windows support will come when the package is on PyPi).

The documentation is hosted here: https://nrgten.readthedocs.io/en/latest
