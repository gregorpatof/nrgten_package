The Najmanovich Research Group Toolkit for Elastic Networks (NRGTEN) is a Python
package allowing the easy use and benchmarking of Elastic Network Models (ENMs) such as ANM, STeM
and ENCoM. The examples in this guide use ENCoM as the default
model, however all the uses and metrics described work for ANM and STeM, the other ENMs currently implemented
in NRGTEN. Other ENMs could easily be implemented by extending some already-present classes.
