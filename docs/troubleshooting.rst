Troubleshooting
===============

Python version
--------------

NRGTEN requires Python 3.6 or higher. If you see an error message that looks like::

	Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement nrgten (from version: )
	No matching distribution found for nrgten

It probably means that you are using Python 2.x. You can try the installation command
using **pip3** instead of **pip** and **python3** instead of **python** to run the examples.
If you do not have these commands installed, you need to install Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
